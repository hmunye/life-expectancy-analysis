## 1 Introduction

This dataset includes comprehensive information on 179 countries spanning from 2000 to 2015, covering aspects like life expectancy, health indicators, immunization rates, and economic and demographic data. Originally sourced from Kaggle, it underwent updates to rectify inaccuracies and missing values. Population, GDP, and life expectancy figures were updated from World Bank data, while data on vaccinations, alcohol consumption, BMI, HIV rates, mortality, and other health metrics were sourced from the World Health Organization. Additional information on schooling was gathered from the University of Oxford's Our World in Data project. Missing values were addressed using strategies such as filling with the closest three-year average or the regional average. Countries with significant missing data were excluded, and the remaining countries were categorized based on their Gross National Income per capita into developed vs developing economies, following guidelines from organizations like the World Trade Organization and the UN.

#### 1.1 Data Understanding

Columns in the dataset:

-   **Country:** List of the 179 countries

-   **Region:** 179 countries are distributed in 9 regions. E.g. Africa, Asia, Oceania, European Union, Rest of Europe and etc.

-   **Year:** Years observed from 2000 to 2015

-   **Infant_deaths:** Represents infant deaths per 1000 population

-   **Thinness_five_nine_years:** Prevalence of thinness among children aged 5-9 years. BMI \< -2 standard deviations below the median

-   **Schooling:** Average years that people aged 25+ spent in formal education

-   **Economy_status_Developed:** Developed country

-   **Economy_status_Developing:** Developing county

-   **Life_expectancy:** Average life expectancy of both genders in different years from 2010 to 2015

#### 1.2 Data Source

Original dataset can be found here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated>

For ease of use we have re-uploaded the dataset to this Github repository created for this group project:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmunye/life-expectancy-analysis/main/data/Life-Expectancy-Data-Updated.csv>

## 2 Data Loading

#### 2.1 Importing Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

#### 2.2 Loading and Understanding the Data

Load the dataset from our groups github.

```{r}

data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmunye/life-expectancy-analysis/main/data/Life-Expectancy-Data-Updated.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

Display the first 5 rows of the dataset

```{r}
head(data, 5)
```

The shape of the data frame

```{r}
# Get the number of rows
num_rows <- nrow(data)

# Get the number of columns
num_cols <- ncol(data)

# Print the results
cat("Number of rows:", num_rows, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", num_cols, "\n")
```

Summary of the Data Frame

```{r}
summary(data)

```

#### 2.3 Categorizing the Datasets Attributes

-   Categorical (nominal):

    -   Country

    -   Region

    -   Economic Status

-   Numerical (Nominal):

    -   None

-   Numerical (discrete):

    -   Year

    -   Infant Deaths

    -   Under-Five deaths

-   Numerical (Interval)

    -   BMI

-   Numerical (Ratio)

    -   Life Expectancy
    -   Adult Mortality
    -   Alchol
    -   Hepatitis B
    -   Measles
    -   Polio
    -   Diptheria
    -   HIV/AIDS
    -   GDP
    -   Population
    -   Thinness 5-9
    -   Thinness 10-9
    -   Schooling

-   Put Reasoning here (Why each is what it is)

    -   **Someone please double check me.**

Creating a list of all nominal/factors

Regions

```{r}
data |>
distinct(Region)
```

Country

```{r}
data |>
  distinct(Country)
```

Year

```{r}
data |>
distinct(Year)
```

For the purpose of data analaytics in R Studio, it is a good practice to change the categorical variables into factors

```{r}
data$Country <- factor(df$Country)
data()$Region <- factor(df$Region)
data$Year <- factor(df$Year)

glimpse(df)
```

## 3 Data Cleaning

### 3.1 Handling Null Values

The original data set had several hundred missing values. While the data is publicly available as it is all published by the various nations of the world and the World Heath Organization , it is not feasible with our teams man hours to manually enter each missing value.

#### 3.1.1 Treating Null Values

There were several options when it came to the missing values, We could ignore years with a high amount of them (Such as 2015), we could simple exclude them from the data set, or put in the average value of the column for the missing value.

#### Decision for Treating Null Values

When doing research on how to handle the missing values, Our group leader found a data set that has already "fixed" the missing values. This new data set first grouped each country into regions, from there the average value of each column was found by region. This is a very clean way to ensure that different regions do not effect each other, while still filling in the missing values.

#### Approach

The group moved forward with the "Fixed" dataset.
